# Exercise 1

-   **Take a look at the following visualization.**
   -   For each group of text labels, note how one would add and modify them.
   -   Discuss how to automate the placement of the labels in- and outside of the bars.


*Add your answers here.*



# Exercise 2

-   **Create a function that plots the famous Gapminder chart, highlighting one of the continents.**
   -   Extend the code below to annotate a continent your choice of with {ggforce}.
   -   Turn the code into a function with the utility to annotate any continent.
   -   Optional: Create a second function to highlight a country.

```{r}
#| label: gapminder-plot
install.packages(setdiff("gapminder", rownames(installed.packages())))

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)

(gm2007 <- filter(gapminder, year == 2007))

ggplot(gm2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point( 
    aes(size = pop), alpha = .5

    breaks = c(500, 2000, 8000, 32000),
    labels = scales::label_dollar(accuracy = 1)
